# Rogue game project
# FOP 2024 Sharif University
The finalized version of the game Rogue, also known as Rogue: Exploring the Dungeons of Doom, was originally developed in the 1980s for Unix-based computers.
In this game, the player starts in the first level, defeating waves of monsters in each level while collecting weapons, talismans, weapons, and flasks, trying to defend themselves from traps, boss arenas, and monsters.
Each game contains 4 normal levels and 1 last level for the treasure room. Each level contains 6 to 9 rooms with are completely random in size and position and each one has a staircase that will lead to the next level.
This project was divided into two phases, one for the game functionality and the map layout and the other half for the monsters and their AI and also the combat. 
Rogue was the final project for the class of 2024 - FOP of Sharif University which was inspired by the 1980s Rogue game using ncurses and SQL libraries in C.
